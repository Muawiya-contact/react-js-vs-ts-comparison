# ⚔️ React: JavaScript vs TypeScript Comparison

This repository compares how React projects differ when written using **JavaScript (JS)** and **TypeScript (TS)**.

## 🧠 Key Concepts

| Concept          | JavaScript (JS)                            | TypeScript (TS)                                 |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Typing           | Dynamic (no enforced types)                | Static (enforced types)                         |
| Error Detection  | Runtime errors                             | Compile-time + runtime errors                   |
| Safety           | Risk of bugs due to flexible typing        | Prevents many bugs before running               |
| Developer Tools  | Basic autocomplete                         | Advanced autocomplete & IntelliSense            |
| Learning Curve   | Easier to start                            | Steeper, but worth it in large codebases        |

## 🔍 Visual Difference Example
## 📁 Folder Structure

- `js-version/` — React Calculator using JavaScript
- `ts-version/` — React Calculator using TypeScript
## 📌 Summary

Both **JS** and **TS** can build React apps.

- **TypeScript** adds **type safety**, helps catch bugs **before running**, and makes code more **reliable and maintainable**.
- **JavaScript** is more **beginner-friendly** and flexible, but may allow bugs silently.

---

## ✨ Ideal Usage

- Use **JS** for small, fast projects or learning.
- Use **TS** for long-term, team-based, or production apps.
